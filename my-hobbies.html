    Indoor bouldering is my favorite activity, I go climbing basically once or
    twice a week. It is a type of sports that combine both strength of the body
    and climbing technique. I enjoy to make my whole body for balance and love
    the way to figure it out how to get to the top from the bottom. What I
    really enjoy about is that, each climber has its own unique way to get the
    top according to their heights, weights, length their arms, etc, even though
    I can see the route on the wall and make preparation on what to do next, but
    the exact experience always make me fall down, and I need to reconsider the
    route to try again and again, I will then finally break my body's limit and
    make 100% focus on it and forget about the running of time.
